# Price_prediction_used_cars
Developed a predictive model to estimate the selling price of used cars based on a dataset containing information about popular car brands like Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes, Skoda, Toyota, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen. The model uses features such as the car's model, year of manufacture, mileage, transmission type, fuel type, tax, miles per gallon (Mpg), engine size, and manufacturer to provide a reliable estimation of the fair market value. This aids buyers and sellers in making informed decisions regarding the pricing of used cars.
Technology Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook,PowerBi.
